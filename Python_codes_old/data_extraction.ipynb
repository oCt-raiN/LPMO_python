xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Cytosolic phosphofructokinase 1 catalyzes the reaction of fructose 6-phosphate and ATP to form fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ADP. This reaction, irreversible under physiological conditions, is the rate limiting step of glycolysis. Phosphofructokinase 1 activity is allosterically regulated by ATP, citrate, and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.Phosphofructokinase 1 is active as a tetramer (although higher order multimers, not annotated here, may form in vivo). Two isoforms of phosphofructokinase 1 monomer, L and M, are widely expressed in human tissues. Different tissues can contain different homotetramers or heterotetramers: L4 in liver, M4 in muscle, and all possible heterotetramers, L4, L3M, L2M2, LM3, and M4, in red blood cells, for example (Raben et al. 1995; Vora et al. 1980, 1987; Vora 1981). A third isoform, P, is abundant in platelets, where it is found in P4, P3L, P2L2, and PL3 tetramers (Eto et al. 1994; Vora et al. 1987).</p>\n","\n","        </notes>\n","\n","

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG) is the first energy rich intermediate of glycolysis. Cytosolic glucose 1,6-bisphosphate synthase (PGM2L1) utilises 1,3BPG as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate a series of 1-phosphate sugars. Although 5- and 6-phosphate sugars are poor substrates for PGM2L1, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) is the exception (Maliekal et al. 2007, Veiga-da-Cunha et al. 2008). PGM2L1 complexed with Mg2+ as cofactor, phosphorylates G6P to glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (G1,6BP), a cofactor for phosphomutases and a putative regulator of glycolysis. PGM2L1 is mainly expressed in brain where its activity is particularly high (Maliekal et al. 2007).</p>\n","\n","        </notes>\n","\n","        <annotation>\n","\n","          <rdf:RDF

Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is not itself on the pathway of glycolysis. Rather, it acts as a positive allosteric effector of phosphofructokinase 1, greatly increasing the rate of synthesis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and hence the overall rate of glycolysis. The conversion of PFKFB between its dephosphorylated form, which catalyzes the synthesis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate as described here, and its phosphorylated form, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and orthophosphate plays a central role in the short-term regulation of glycolysis (Pilkis et al. 1995).Four isoforms of PFKFB protein encoded by four different genes exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns. PFKFB1 is expressed in the liver (Algaier and Uyeda 1988), PFKFB2 is expressed in the heart (Hirata et al. 1998), PFKFB3 is ubiquitously expressed (Manes and el-Maghrabi 2005), and PFKFB4, originally described as a testis-specific gene product (Manzano et al. 1999), may also be expressed in several kinds of tumors.</p>\n","\n","        </notes>\n","\n","        <annotation>\n","\n","

This phosphorylation inhibits the enzyme's phosphofructokinase (PFK-2) activity while activating its phosphatase activity. As a result, cytosolic levels of Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2) are reduced. F-2,6-P2 in turn is a key positive regulator of the committed step of glycolysis, so the net effect of this phosphorylation event is a reduced rate of glycolysis.</p>\n","\n","

ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK) can phosphorylate glucose (Glc) using ADP as the phosphate donor to glucose 6-phopshate (G6P). To date, it has not been established whether this phosphorylation supports a significant role in priming glucose for a metabolic fate other than glycolysis (Richter et al. 2012). Stdies of metabolic changes during T cell activation suggest a role for it there (Kaminski et al. 2012).</p>\n","\n","        </notes>\n","\n","        <annotation>\n","\n","          <rdf:RDF

xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Cytosolic enolase catalyzes the reversible reaction of 2 phosphoglycerate to form phosphoenolpyruvate and water, elevating the transfer potential of the phosphoryl group.Enolase is a homodimer and requires Mg++ for activity. Three isozymes have been purified and biochemically characterized. The alpha isoform is expressed in many normal human tissues (Giallongo et al. 1986). The beta isoform is expressed in muscle. Evidence for its function in vivo in humans comes from studies of a patient in whom a point mutation in the gene encoding the enzyme was associated specifically with reduced enolase activity in muscle extracts and with other symptoms consistent with a defect in glycolysis (Comi et al. 2001). The gamma isoform of human enolase is normally expressed in neural tissue and is of possible clinical interest as a marker of some types of neuroendocrine and lung tumors (McAleese et al. 1988). Biochemical studies of the homologous rat proteins indicate that both homo- and heterodimers of enolase form and are enzymatically active (Rider and Taylor 1974).</p>\n","\n","

One of its functions is the isomerisation of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG) to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3BPG) (Rose 1968). In red blood cells, 2,3BPG is the main allosteric effector of hemoglobin, binding preferentially to the deoxygenated hemoglobin tetramer, thus reducing oxygen affinity (Arnone 1972).</p>\n","\n","

glucokinase and the three isoforms of hexokinase catalyze the irreversible reaction of glucose and ATP to form glucose 6 phosphate and ADP. In the body glucokinase is found only in hepatocytes and pancreatic beta cells. Glucokinase and the hexokinase enzymes differ in that glucokinase has a higher Km than the hexokinases and is less readily inhibited by the reaction product. As a result, glucokinase should be inactive in the fasting state when glucose concentrations are low but in the fed state should have an activity proportional to glucose concentration. These features are thought to enable efficient glucose uptake and retention in the liver, and to function as a sensor of glucose concentration coupled to insulin release in pancreatic beta cells (Thorens 2001). Glucokinase mutations are associated with MODY2, a heritable early onset form of type II diabetes (Tanizawa et al. 1991; Takeda et al. 1993). Three human hexokinase enzymes have been characterized, HK1 (Aleshin et al. 1998), HK2 (Lehto et al. 1995), and HK3 (Rijksen at al. 1982).</p>\n","\n","        </notes>\n","\n","

Fructose 2,6 bisphosphate is a key allosteric regulator of PFK1. In its absence the activity of PFK1 is reduced while fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is activated, thus inhibiting glycolysis and favoring gluconeogenesis (Pilkis et al. 1995).</p>\n","\n","        </notes>\n","\n","        <annotation>\n","\n","          <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:vCard=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#\" xmlns:dcterms=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" xmlns:bqmodel=\"http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers/\" xmlns:bqbiol=\"http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers/\">\n","\n","            <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"#metaid_81\">\n","\n","              <dc:creator>\n","\n","                <rdf:Bag>\n","\n","                  <rdf:li rdf:parseType=\"Resource\">\n","\n","                    <vCard:N rdf:parseType=\"Resource\">\n","\n","                      <vCard:Family>Wright</vCard:Family>\n","\n","                      <vCard:Given>Adam</vCard:Given>\n","\n","                    </vCard:N>\n","\n","                    <vCard:ORG rdf:parseType=\"Resource\">\n","\n","                      <vCard:Orgname>OICR</vCard:Orgname>\n","\n","                    </vCard:ORG>\n","\n","                  </rdf:li>\n","\n","                </rdf:Bag>\n","\n","              </dc:creator>\n","\n","              <dcterms:modified rdf:parseType=\"Resource\">\n","\n","                <dcterms:W3CDTF>2022-09-02T04:03:19Z</dcterms:W3CDTF>\n","\n","              </dcterms:modified>\n","\n","              <bqbiol:is>\n","\n","                <rdf:Bag>\n","\n","                  <rdf:li rdf:resource=\"https://identifiers.org/reactome:R-HSA-70262\" />\n","\n","                  <rdf:li rdf:resource=\"https://identifiers.org/GO:0045820\" />\n","\n","                </rdf:Bag>\n","\n","              </bqbiol:is>\n","\n","              <bqbiol:isDescribedBy>\n","\n","                <rdf:Bag>\n","\n","                  <rdf:li rdf:resource=\"https://identifiers.org/pubmed:7574501\" />\n","\n","                </rdf:Bag>\n","\n","              </bqbiol:isDescribedBy>\n","\n","              <bqbiol:is>\n","\n","                <rdf:Bag>\n","\n","                  <rdf:li rdf:resource=\"https://identifiers.org/reactome:R-HSA-70262\" />\n","\n","                </rdf:Bag>\n","\n","              </bqbiol:is>\n","\n","              <bqbiol:is>\n","\n","                <rdf:Bag>\n","\n","                  <rdf:li rdf:resource=\"https://identifiers.org/GO:0004331\" />\n","\n","                </rdf:Bag>\n","\n","              </bqbiol:is>\n","\n","              <bqbiol:is>\n","\n","                <rdf:Bag>\n","\n","                  <rdf:li rdf:resource=\"https://identifiers.org/ec-code:3.1.3.46\" />\n","\n","                </rdf:Bag>\n","\n","              </bqbiol:is>\n","\n","              <bqmodel:hasInstance>\n","\n","                <rdf:Bag>\n","\n","                  <rdf:li rdf:resource=\"https://www.rhea-db.org/rhea/17290\" />\n","\n","                </rdf:Bag>\n","\n","              </bqmodel:hasInstance>\n","\n","            </rdf:Description>\n","\n","          </rdf:RDF>\n","\n","        </annotation>\n","\n","        <listOfReactants>\n","\n","          <speciesReference constant=\"true\" id=\"speciesreference_70262_input_30533\" sboTerm=\"SBO:0000010\" species=\"species_30533\" stoichiometry=\"1\" />\n","\n","          <speciesReference constant=\"true\" id=\"speciesreference_70262_input_29356\" sboTerm=\"SBO:0000010\" species=\"species_29356\" stoichiometry=\"1\" />\n","\n","        </listOfReactants>\n","\n","        <listOfProducts>\n","\n","          <speciesReference constant=\"true\" id=\"speciesreference_70262_output_29372\" sboTerm=\"SBO:0000011\" species=\"species_29372\" stoichiometry=\"1\" />\n","\n","          <speciesReference constant=\"true\" id=\"speciesreference_70262_output_29512\" sboTerm=\"SBO:0000011\" species=\"species_29512\" stoichiometry=\"1\" />\n","\n","        </listOfProducts>\n","\n","        <listOfModifiers>\n","\n","          <modifierSpeciesReference id=\"modifierspeciesreference_70262_catalyst_163745\" sboTerm=\"SBO:0000013\" species=\"species_163745\" />\n","\n","        </listOfModifiers>\n","\n","      </reaction>\n","\n","      <reaction compartment=\"compartment_70101\" fast=\"false\" id=\"reaction_70471\" metaid=\"metaid_82\" name=\"alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate &lt;=&gt; D-fructose 6-phosphate\" reversible=\"false\">\n","\n","        <notes>\n","\n","          <p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase catalyzes the reversible interconversion of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate (Tsuboi et al. 1958; Noltmann 1972; Bloxham and Lardy 1973).

The biochemical details of this reaction were worked out by C and G Cori and their colleagues (Taylor et al. 1948; Cori et al. 1948).While there are multiple human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-like pseudogenes, there is only one glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene expressed in somatic tissue (Benham and Povey 1989; Heinz and Freimuller 1982; Ercolani et al. 1988), and studies of aged human erythrocytes suggest that variant forms of the enzyme arise as a result of post-translational modifications (Edwards et al. 1976). There is, however, an authentic second isoform of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase whose expression is confined to spermatogenic cells of the testis (Welch et al. 2000).</p>\n","\n","

pyruvate kinase catalyzes the transfer of a high-energy phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, forming pyruvate and ATP. This reaction, an instance of substrate-level phosphorylation, is essentially irreversible under physiological conditions.Four isozymes of human pyruvate kinase have been described, L, R, M1 and M2. Isozymes L and R are encoded by alternatively spliced transcripts of the PKLR gene; isozymes M1 and M2 are encoded by alternatively spliced transcripts of PKM2. In the body, L pyruvate kinase is found in liver (Tani et al. 1988), R in red blood cells (Kanno et al. 1991), M1 in muscle, heart and brain (Takenaka et al. 1991), and M2 in early fetal tissues and tumors (e.g., Lee et al. 2008). In all cases, the active form of the enzyme is a homotetramer, activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Valentini et al. 2002; Dombrauckas et al. 2005). Mutations in PKLR have been associated with hemolytic anemias (e.g., Zanella et al. 2005).</p>\n","\n","        </notes>\n","\n","        <annotation>\n","\n","          <rdf:RDF

The active form of the enzyme is a monomer and requires Mg++ (Yoshida and Watanabe 1972; Huang et al. 1980a,b). This is the first substrate level phosphorylation reaction in glycolysis. Two PGK isoforms are known: PGK1 is widely expressed in the body while PGK2 (Chen et al. 1976; McCarrey and Thomas 1987) appears to be confined to sperm cells.</p>\n","\n","        </notes>\n","\n","
